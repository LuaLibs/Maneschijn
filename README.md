# Maneschijn
WIP: UI for LÃ–VE using Ryanna


I'll add more info later as it comes in...
This will be a collection of libraries in order to have a GUI style interface for some programs I need in the future.

# NOTICE

A long as this notice is here, it does not really make sense to clone or fork this project. The development has only just begun, so too little of this will work to make this a valuable addition to your work, haha!
When this notice has been removed, you can do it (although it may then still be in beta).

# Etymology

Since "Lua" means "Moon" in Portuguese, Maneschijn is a bit of a pun to that as it means "Moonshine" in Dutch. :P
