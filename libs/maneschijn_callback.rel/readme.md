# Maneschijn callback

This is the default callback routine as used by Maneschijn
Using this callback turns off the regular callback system Love uses and substitutes it with its own.
When using the standard Maneschijn module this library is called automatically....
You can of course always use your own approach in stead by calling the libs yourself one by one (if you know what you are doing)
