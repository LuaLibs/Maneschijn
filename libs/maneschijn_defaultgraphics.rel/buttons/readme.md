# Default buttons for Maneschijn

These buttons were created by leandrosciola, and were released in the public domain,  on [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org/detail/65623/button)


Note .button_base.png is not needed, and Ryanna has been configured to ignore hidden files (by unix standards hidden). I only included it for "backup" reasons.
